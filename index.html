                    <p>"Who am I?  I am a father of six children - to date this is my greatest
                    achievement.  Full Stack Development at SMU is my current devotion.  My current passion
                    is machine learning, AI and Python.  I am working on my intel certifications and loving it.
                    I have never been lucky enough to work in technology but have always found a job in technology
                    in whatever job I have created.  Yes I have created every job that I've had in the last 12 years.
                    In every company I have started I have created my company website using HTML and PHP with a tiny bit of CSS."
                    </p>
                    <p>"CSS scares me but I have found comfort in bootstrap.  I love the outdoors
                    and spending time with my family.  I am in the process of raising three eagle scouts.
                    I am a dedicated homeschooler to my children and homeschoolee to myself.  I hope one 
                    day to bridge the gap between chemical and digital data.  I am pursuing a degree in 
                    Neuroscience (but tired of traditional schooling methods).  I'm excited to hit the workforce
                    and offer my creativity, passion, and dependability to an amazing company.  Bio version 1.0. Signing out.
